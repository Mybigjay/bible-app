Dear Professor Beatrice,

My name is Emelogu Blessing Ngozi and I have  completed my master’s degree in Systems Enginering from  University of Lagos Akoka with a CGPA of 3.8/5.0. During my Masters’s studies, I did a research project titled ‘Ant Colony Model of Physiological Presentation of Asthma’. This is aimed at producing a nanorobot that will aid in the management of asthma. Presently, I am assisting my project supervisor with other research projects he is involved with.

I have visited your research articles and found my field of interest in your research area.  I am especially interested in  artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms and genetic programming and their applications in cyber scam detection and prevention.
My passion to learn further and make significant contribution as a researcher drives me towards an  MSc. study. I would very much like the opportunity to work under your supervision and would appreciate if you could review my attached documents (C.V and university transcript) and let me know what the possibilities might be.
Thank you for your time and kind consideration.
Sincerely,
Emelogu Blessing Ngozi
